There is a very low probability that after the admin changes the order status, when the user logs in again to view the order, an error "Thread 1: "Layout requested for visible navigation bar, <SwiftUI.UIKitNavigationBaxxxxxxxxx" will be reported. We found that this may be due to the xcode compiler Caused by the problem. If you encounter this problem, you can restart the program and you can use it and view the order normally！！！！！！！！
